# simple-php-mvc

Simple MVC using PHP programming to show as an example to anyone who asks me about my PHP knowledge. 
This framework and its components were made from the scratch for my own study on a Web language that I have enjoyed since the first time I took a time to practice. 

# It was a pretty newbie project and should not be used by anyone
## Also, it only worked for me to learn some PHP basics
## Never use your own homemade framework
## It will probably suck when concerning security flaws, design problems and others
## I know mine did
